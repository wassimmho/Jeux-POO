# Shadow Adventures
## Overview
Once upon a time, the King of Elaria disappeared, and his magical shadow broke into four pieces. The shadow gave great power, and whoever claimed it could become the next ruler.
You are one of four orphans, all marked by fate, raised to believe you are the rightful heir. At first, you work together to find the shadow fragments, but as the journey goes on, trust fades. Each of you wants the power for yourself, and the fight for the throne begins.

Shadow Adventures is an action-adventure game developed in Unity with C#. Players embark on a journey to find the pieces of a powerful magical shadow, facing challenges, puzzles, and other orphans vying for control of the throne.
